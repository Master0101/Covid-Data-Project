# Covid-Data-Project
My project is a simple and clear way of looking at COVID-19 statistics. I had a problem: whenever I searched for Coronavirus statistics for any country, 
many conflicting and complicated results came up. I couldn't understand or trust this data. This led me to make a COVID-19 Tracker that 
used reliable data to display simple COVID-19 statistics for every country and territory in the world. All this data is sourced from Johns 
Hopkins University. My project allows users to view simple data stats and visualizations for every country. I hope this will help people find simple, credible 
information and prevent distortions of the truth in the future.
